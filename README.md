I made this to-do list with React and Bootstrap:

How it works:
After logging in, the user can add multiple tasks, visualise them and filter them according to category. The tasks are ordered by date and it is possible to click on the single task and delete it.
Both forms to login and to add the todo have validation logic implemented.

The app contains a couple of tests made with Jest adn React testing library and I look forward to adding more :-)
