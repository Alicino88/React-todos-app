The App is still under development...

The main idea is to apply multiple concepts I have studied while following the Udemy complete React course.

The app works like follows:
After logging in the user can add multiple tasks, visualise them and filter them according to category. The tasks are ordered according to the due date.
It is possible to click on the single task and delete it.

I have decided to use bootstrap as I wanted a chance to use it for the first time.
